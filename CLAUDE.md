# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a simple portfolio website project currently containing:
- `portfolio.html` - The main portfolio HTML file (currently empty)
- `README.md` - Basic project description

## Architecture

This appears to be a static HTML portfolio website project in its early stages. The project structure is minimal with just the main HTML file present.

## Development

Since this is a static HTML portfolio site, development is straightforward:
- Edit `portfolio.html` directly for content changes
- No build process or package manager is currently configured
- Open `portfolio.html` in a web browser to view changes locally

## File Structure

```
Portfolio-Website/
├── README.md
├── portfolio.html
└── CLAUDE.md (this file)
```

The project is currently in initial setup phase with the main portfolio HTML file being empty and ready for content development.
